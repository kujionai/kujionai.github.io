      <p class="blog_post_quote">"We're going to set you on track to blow your own mind."<br>- Shereef Bishay</p>

      <p>When I was a six years old, I wanted to be a Unicorn when I grew up.</p>

      <p>"What do you want to be when you grow up?" is a surprisingly common question to ask 6-year-olds If you ask me. I mean, these are individuals who know very little about the career opportunities available to them. Anyhow, over the next sixteen years, my one-horned dream dissolved into a rainbow-infused puddle of indecisiveness.</p>

      <p>Recently, I've reconsidered that epic dream of unicornhood. I mean, what <i>is</i> a unicorn, exactly?</p>

      <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/last-unicorn-1.jpg" alt="Title" />

      <p>Turns out, for the past week, I'm pretty sure I've been in a virtual room <i>full</i> of unicorns at <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>. Here's why.</p>

      <h3>Unicorns are passionate.</h3>
      <p>We're in the Kitchen. THIS IS OUR KITCHEN. We make this kitchen-made soup. As Shereef hypes, I'm beyond excited to crush some knowledge with a group of people who take ownership of their learning and are invested in diving into a new, extra-magic code-filled world togather.</p>

      <h3>Unicorns explode with communal magical power when they're around other unicorns.</h3>

      <iframe class="blog_post_img" src="http://giphy.com/embed/hSx3HrByytK2k?html5=true" width="480" height="210" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

      <p>True to Shereef's commitment to humbleness, I'm super inspired by how open my peers at Dev Bootcamp are about <i>what</i> they don't know to <i>people</i> they don't know (yet!). They gain energy through the knowledge that they are not alone. After all, nobody wants to be <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxoJLJx-mJw" target="_blank">The Last Unicorn.</a></p>

      <h3>Unicorns can fly when they really need to.</h3>
      <p>"Clearly, we'd all jumped off a cliff," Shereef muses over his first DBC cohort. But, guess what? They're all totally fine. We'll be fine too.</p>

      <p>Because we're unicorns, and we've finally decided what we want to be when we grow up. I think my mind might be prematurely blown.</p>

      <p>Have you ever... wanted to go back to before you did something you really wish you maybe hadn&#8217;t done?</p>

      <p>For example, I once ate seventeen delicious bagels in one 32-minute sitting. Maybe I wish I <i>hadn&#8217;t</i> eaten so many bagels.</p>

      <p>If you&#8217;re a computer programmer, you can do just that - return to a previous version of reality in which something that was done is yet-to-be-done. They call this magical tool <b>version control</b>.</p>

      <p>Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>

      <p>Let&#8217;s say I use a handy <b>version control management system</b> called <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git.</a></p>

      <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/blog/git-github/git.png" alt="Git" />

      <p>With git, I can manage all my versions on my computer. Except (with inspiration from the ingenious <a class="blog_post_link" href="https://twitter.com/SostephOh" target="_blank">Stephanie Oh</a>'s awesome blog post <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://stephaniehoh.github.io/blog/2013/10/07/git-vs-github-for-dummies/" target="_blank">Git vs. GitHub for Dummies</a>), instead of managing my <i>code</i>, let's just say it manages my <i>life</i>.</p>

      <p>I save versions of myself regularly. I saved the version of me that had eaten eleven bagels in one sitting. I saved the even older version of me that had eaten a mere six bagels in one sitting. Heck, I even saved the long-forgotten version of me, decades past, that hadn&#8217;t even <i>heard</i> of bagels!<p>

      <p>So, back to the present me, seventeen bagels strong. And by strong, I mean very, very ill. I will spare you all details, because this blog post is about web development and not puke.</i>

      <p>Whatever though, because I&#8217;ve got a FREAKING TIME MACHINE. I&#8217;m going back in time to before I even <i>heard</i> of bagels.</p>

      <p>Heard of what? No idea. Heck yeah. Version control.</p>

      <p>But, you know, there&#8217;s no reason to keep versions of your code, or versions of your life, to yourself. In my case, I&#8217;ve got to share that 17-bagel me with the world.</p>
            in
      <p>This is where <a class="blog_post_link" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> comes in.</p>

      <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/blog/git-github/github.png" alt="Github" />

      <p>While git lets my code hang out locally on my machine, Github is a literal <b>hub on the internet</b> where everybody can share their stuff.</p>

      <p>Makes a lot of sense to share your code. When you put it out there, others have the opportunity to learn from it.</p>

      <p>With that in mind, you might as well share your life too (but maybe not on Github)! Just as with code, I'm sure we've all got tons to learn from each other about how to rock out this life thing.</p>

      <p>And, of course, we can learn a bit from each other about what not to do as well.</p>

      <p>So, I&#8217;m starting an intensive, 18-week <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Web Development Bootcamp</a> in two weeks time! The excitement is figuratively <i>killing</i> me.</p>

      <p>To ensure students are culturally on the same page before the first day of school, we&#8217;ve been assigned some self-initiation. This includes a <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> original <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://vimeo.com/99779530" target="_blank">vid</a> on Emotional Intelligence (EQ).</p>

      <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://i.imgur.com/V1iLoTi.jpg" alt="Chade-Meng Tan" />

      <p>Inspired by above <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://chademeng.com/" target="_blank">funny guy</a> Chade-Meng Tan&#8217;s project <a class="blog_post_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8fcqrNO7so" target="_blank">Search Inside Yourself</a>, EQ is a trainable competency consisting of <i>awareness</i>, <i>empathy</i>, and <i>intuition</i>.</p>

      <p><b>Awareness</b> is the ability to catch an emotion as a bodily response early, slow it down, and watch it happen. You can then choose how to best handle your emotion; you own your emotion instead of your emotion owning you.</p>

      <p><b>Empathy</b> is the awareness of emotions in others as they arise. This includes knowing the difference between an ask and a need, or searching beyond words to understand the needs of others.</p>

      <p><b>Intuition</b> is a bodily sensation of the right path in the moment. It is the ability to listen to your body and not just your cognitive brain.</p>

      <div class="tagline_1">Becoming a Feedback badass</div>
      <div class="tagline_2">Developing With Your Community :D</div>
    </div>

    <!--<div id="date">October 1st, 2014</div>-->

    <div class="content">
      <p>Because the folks at <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> believe that feedback is central to learning, their next <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://vimeo.com/99780302" target="_blank">video</a> (created by DBC Head of Admissions Karim Bishay) outlines the four distinct skills required to become a feedback badass: <i>soliciting,</i> feedback, <i>receiving</i> feedback, <i>giving</i> feedback, and <i>integrating</i> feedback.</p>

      <p><b>Soliciting</b> feedback requires knowing the difference between a request and a demand. When asking to give or receive feedback, make sure that the other person can say no without emotional punishment.</p>

      <p><b>Receiving</b> Recieving feedback calls for emotional control. Bishay shows us the <i>Compass of Shame</i>, a visual aid that summarizes different ways we respond to difficult feelings.</p>

      <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://i.imgur.com/7Do5uK8.gif" alt="Compass of Shame" />

      <p>When you receive feedback and notice yourself coping with shame via one of the above strategies, allow yourself to become aware of that impulse and then chose not to completely give in to it.</p>

      <p><b>Giving</b> feedback must be actionable (something they can change), specific (pertaining to one particular action), and kind (honest about the impact their action had on you instead of projecting or judging).</p>

      <p><b>Integrating</b> feedback involves taking from feedback what is useful to you instead of accepting all feedback as universal truth.</p>

      <p>That&#8217;s a little bit about feedback! Watch Dev Bootcamp&#8217;s <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://vimeo.com/99780302"target="_blank">vid</a> to learn more.</p>
