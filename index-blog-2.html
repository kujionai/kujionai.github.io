        <p><a class="blog_post_link" href="" target="_blank">Learning preferences</a> are pretty sweet, right? Thinking styles are also pretty sweet.</p>

        <p>Professor Anthony Gregorc&#8217;s <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target="_blank">questionnaire</a> on <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target="_blank">The Learning Web</a> checks your Personal Thinking Style. Gregorc divided these into four groups:</p>

        <p class="blog_post_quote"><b>Concrete Sequential Thinkers (CS)</b> tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.
        <br>
        <b>Concrete Random Thinkers (CR)</b> are experimenters.
        <br>
        <b>Abstract Random Thinkers (AR)</b> organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.
        <br>
        <b>Abstract Sequential Thinkers (AS)</b> love the world of theory and abstract thought.</p>

        <p>Here&#8217;s a graph of my Personal Thinking Style.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://i.imgur.com/QjPxbuQ.gif" alt="Title" />

        <p>I scored equally high as both a Concrete and Abstract Random thinker. Here&#8217;s my scene according to a Boise State University <a class="blog_post_link" href="https://aae.boisestate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Anthony-Gregorc-4-Mind-Styles.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>:</p>

        <p class="blog_post_quote"><i>Concrete random thinkers</i> are experimenters. says DePorter: &quot;Like concrete sequentials, they&#8217;re based in reality, but are willing to take more of a trial-and-error approach. Because of this, they often make the intuitive leaps necessary for true creative thought. They have a strong need to find alternatives and do things in their own way.&quot; If youâ€™re a CR, use your divergent thinking ability. Believe that it&#8217;s good to see things from more than one viewpoint. Put yourself in a position to solve problems. But give yourself deadlines. Accept your need for change. Try and work with people who value divergent thinking.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Abstract random thinkers</i> organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments. Says DePorter: &quot;The &lsquo;real&lsquo; world for abstract random learners is the world of feelings and emotions. The AR&#8217;s mind absorbs ideas, information and impressions and organizes them through reflection. They remember best if information is personalized. They feel constricted when they&#8217;re subjected to a very structured environment.&quot; If you&#8217;re an AR, use your natural ability to work with others. Recognize how strongly emotions influence your concentration. Build on your strength of learning by association. Look at the big picture first. Be careful to allow enough time to finish the job. Remind yourself to do things through plenty of visual clues, such as colored stickers pasted up where you&#8217;ll see them.</p>

        <p>So, I&#8217;m starting an intensive, 18-week <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Web Development Bootcamp</a> in two weeks time! The excitement is figuratively <i>killing</i> me.</p>

        <p>To ensure students are culturally on the same page before the first day of school, we&#8217;ve been assigned some self-initiation. This includes a <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> original <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://vimeo.com/99779530" target="_blank">vid</a> on Emotional Intelligence (EQ).</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://i.imgur.com/V1iLoTi.jpg" alt="Chade-Meng Tan" />

        <p>Inspired by above <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://chademeng.com/" target="_blank">funny guy</a> Chade-Meng Tan&#8217;s project <a class="blog_post_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8fcqrNO7so" target="_blank">Search Inside Yourself</a>, EQ is a trainable competency consisting of <i>awareness</i>, <i>empathy</i>, and <i>intuition</i>.</p>

        <p><b>Awareness</b> is the ability to catch an emotion as a bodily response early, slow it down, and watch it happen. You can then choose how to best handle your emotion; you own your emotion instead of your emotion owning you.</p>

        <p><b>Empathy</b> is the awareness of emotions in others as they arise. This includes knowing the difference between an ask and a need, or searching beyond words to understand the needs of others.</p>

        <p><b>Intuition</b> is a bodily sensation of the right path in the moment. It is the ability to listen to your body and not just your cognitive brain.</p>

        <p>Interested in learning more about EQ? Watch Dev Bootcamp&#8217;s <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://vimeo.com/99779530" target="_blank">vid</a> or cozy up to Chade-Meng Tan&#8217;s <a class="blog_post_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8fcqrNO7so" target="_blank">Search Inside Yourself</a>.</p>

      <div id="content">
        <p>Because the folks at <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> believe that feedback is central to learning, their next <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://vimeo.com/99780302" target="_blank">video</a> (created by DBC Head of Admissions Karim Bishay) outlines the four distinct skills required to become a feedback ninja: <i>soliciting,</i> feedback, <i>receiving</i> feedback, <i>giving</i> feedback, and <i>integrating</i> feedback.</p>

        <p><b>Soliciting</b> feedback requires knowing the difference between a request and a demand. When asking to give or receive feedback, make sure that the other person can say no without emotional punishment.</p>

        <p><b>Receiving</b> Recieving feedback calls for emotional control. Bishay shows us the <i>Compass of Shame</i>, a visual aid that summarizes different ways we respond to difficult feelings.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://i.imgur.com/7Do5uK8.gif" alt="Compass of Shame" />

        <p>When you receive feedback and notice yourself coping with shame via one of the above strategies, allow yourself to become aware of that impulse and then chose not to completely give in to it.</p>

        <p><b>Giving</b> feedback must be actionable (something they can change), specific (pertaining to one particular action), and kind (honest about the impact their action had on you instead of projecting or judging).</p>

        <p><b>Integrating</b> feedback involves taking from feedback what is useful to you instead of accepting all feedback as universal truth.</p>

        <p>That&#8217;s a little bit about feedback! Watch Dev Bootcamp&#8217;s <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://vimeo.com/99780302"target="_blank">vid</a> to learn more.</p>
