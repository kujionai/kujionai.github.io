      <div class="content">

        <p>Dear People I've Paired With,

        <p>When you gave me the pairing-session green-light of affirmation, I was on-the-next-level pumped. Optimized learning with a generous topping of world-class friendship, all wrapped up in a one-to-three-hour bundle! I literally could not wait.</p>
        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://media2.giphy.com/media/hKW0FFvpVSvmM/giphy.gif" />

        <p>Also, I was pretty nervous. I mean, what if you know way more about Ruby classes than I do? You probably do. Scratch that - you DEFINITELY do. Oh, the shame ... maybe I should put this pairing date off until, you know ... until after I know everything too.</p>

        <p>But you were so, so cool. I learned a lot from you for sure, but the most surprising thing that happened is that you learned from me, too. You were into my knowledge of Sublime Text shortcuts. You thanked me for teaching you a new method I'd been playing around with. To my surprise, I emerged from our time together feeling like I was a valuable member of an awesome team - the team of ME and YOU.</p>

        <p>So, I went home. I slept well. I woke up the next morning with bright eyes and a heart full of code. And when I recieved your feedback from our pairing session, I couldn't help but take the <i>way to be naturally great at this!</i> parts like ...</p>

        <p>... And the <i>you could work on this!</i> feedback a little more like ...</p>

        <p>But, I really am learning from the feedback you took the time to give me. And I'm growing! I've become more aware of when I've changed the subject from booleans to baked goods, and I'm getting more and more comfortable each code-aborative day with speaking up when our syntax is wack.</p>

        <p>And, when I leave you feedback, I'll do my best to follow your lead as I offer you my perspective.</p>

        <p>What I'm trying to say is, <i>thank you so much</i>, People I've Paired With. Thank you for hearing me out. Thank you for taking the time to give me the nurturing honesty that leads to growth. And thank you for giving me the courage to return the favor.</p>

        <p>Until next time,<br><span class="signature">Rosa Pergams</span></p>
