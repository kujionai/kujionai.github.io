        <p class="blog_post_quote">"We're going to set you on track to blow your own mind."<br>- Shereef Bishay</p>

        <p>When I was a six years old, I wanted to be a Unicorn when I grew up.</p>

        <p>"What do you want to be when you grow up?" is a surprisingly common question to ask 6-year-olds If you ask me. I mean, these are individuals who know very little about the career opportunities available to them. Anyhow, over the next sixteen years, my one-horned dream dissolved into a rainbow-infused puddle of indecisiveness.</p>

        <p>Recently, I've reconsidered that epic dream of unicornhood. I mean, what <i>is</i> a unicorn, exactly?</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="../imgs/last-unicorn-1.jpg" alt="Title" />

        <p>Turns out, for the past week, I'm pretty sure I've been in a virtual room <i>full</i> of unicorns at <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>. Here's why.</p>

        <h3>Unicorns are passionate.</h3>
        <p>We're in the Kitchen. THIS IS OUR KITCHEN. We make this kitchen-made soup. As Shereef hypes, I'm beyond excited to crush some knowledge with a group of people who take ownership of their learning and are invested in diving into a new, extra-magic code-filled world togather.</p>

        <h3>Unicorns explode with communal magical power when they're around other unicorns.</h3>

        <iframe class="blog_post_img" src="http://giphy.com/embed/hSx3HrByytK2k?html5=true" width="480" height="210" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

        <p>True to Shereef's commitment to humbleness, I'm super inspired by how open my peers at Dev Bootcamp are about <i>what</i> they don't know to <i>people</i> they don't know (yet!). They gain energy through the knowledge that they are not alone. After all, nobody wants to be <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxoJLJx-mJw" target="_blank">The Last Unicorn.</a></p>

        <h3>Unicorns can fly when they really need to.</h3>
        <p>"Clearly, we'd all jumped off a cliff," Shereef muses over his first DBC cohort. But, guess what? They're all totally fine. We'll be fine too.</p>

        <p>Because we're unicorns, and we've finally decided what we want to be when we grow up. I think my mind might be prematurely blown.</p>
