        <p class="blog_post_quote">"Never trust anyone who says they do not see color. This means to them, you are invisible."
        <br>
        - Nayyirah Waheed</p>

        <p>Let me tell you a story about the most racist thing I've ever done. That I'm aware of, anyways.</p>

        <p>Imagine - A steamy Mid-July in Washington, DC. The vegan restaurant where I bartended while completing an <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://www.hrc.org/" target="_blank">internship</a> blocks away. A legend amongst the waiters by the name of John Cho (I'd never met him, but he was clearly the king of infamy). And a former waiter at the same establishment, Callaway Don.</p>

        <p>Callaway Don enters the vegan restaurant, hoping to run into old co-workers. Upon noticing him chatting up the staff from behind the bar, a twisted and shameful lightbulb goes off in my head.</p>

        <p>Before I knew it, I had word-puked all over the poor guy.</p>

        <p>"Are you John Cho?" I asked Callaway Don with earnest. He was not.</p>
        <p>It just so happens that <code class="inline_code">one_asian_person != another_asian_person</code>. There can even be multiple Asian people who've worked at the same restaurant! Apparently, these were both revelations to me.</p>

        <p>When we do <i>racist things</i> (and they are VERY easy to do), we isolate other people. We send them the message that they don't belong, and that we don't see their personhood with the same validity with which we perceive our own. <i>Racist things</i> can minimize intelligence, deny individuality, and violate self-worth. And most of the time, <i>racist things</i> just kind of come out when our intentions are only the best.</p>

        <p>With that in mind, here are some <i>racist things</i> (all very, very common) that I (a black person) am hurt by. If you've done any of these <i>racist things</i>, don't freak! I was forgiven for my <i>racist thing</i> in spades (Callaway Don and I just celebrated our two-year anniversary). Everyone knows that no one is born knowing everything (just, you know, try to cut it out from now on).</p>

        <p><b>Sticking your fingers into my hair.</b> I'm a person, not a petting zoo. Personal space, y'all.</p>

        <p><b>"You don't sound black at all."</b> I Apologize. Please provide me with lessons on how to be 'more black.'</p>

        <p><b>"You know, I don't even really see you as black."</b> OPEN YOUR EYES.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr01/2013/5/2/10/anigif_enhanced-buzz-2053-1367505162-0.gif" />
        <p><b>Exaggeratedly snapping your neck in my direction.</b> I have never even seen a black person do this.</p>

        <p>So, that's my abbreviated list of <i>racist things</i> that make me sad. Racial microagressions such as these imply that being black makes me anything besides awesome, and they take a lot of energy to deal with. Do I speak strangely? Do I look weird? Or am I just in the wrong place? You can start to see how stereotypes can make one feel like an outsider, and there's nothing more detrimental to success than the belief that you're not welcome.</p>

        <p>Let's learn our lessons, forgive ourselves, and do our best to crush the stereotypes we hold before they smother our friends. It's easier said than done, but we've all got to start somewhere.</p>
