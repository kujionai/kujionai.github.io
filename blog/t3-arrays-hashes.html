      <div class="content">
        <p>This past Wednesday, I had the pleasure of spending a ridiculous amount of super-fun and extra-educational quality time with DBC cohort-mate and brand-new alpaca-loving friend <a>Mai</a>.<p>

        <p>As she was visiting NYC from Virginia, I chose our meeting place. We naturally found ourselves at Manhattan's favorite how-is-this-so-freaking-delicious bagel shop.</p>

        <p>It also so happened that I had a gross cold on this particular outing. So, let's say I was going to write a program to ease up the order process. Just so I don't have to repeat myself too much with my sore throat.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna write two programs. I'm gonna write one with an <b>array</b>. Then I'm gonna write one with a <b>hash</b>.</p>

        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>Objects in an array are indexed with integers starting at 0. You can't really associate them with anything else besides those numbers, so they're great for lists of really similar things. I'll use them to pile on the tofu spreads (that's cream cheese for vegans &amp; lactose-intolerant people).</p>

<!--         <img class="blog_post_img" src="../imgs/array.png" alt="Title" /> -->
         <pre><code>tofu_spread = ["plain", "spinach", "honey walnut"]

tofu_spread.each do |flavor|
  puts "I want some #{flavor} tofu spread!"
  puts "Just add it on top."
end

puts "That's all! Thanks!"</code></pre>

<pre><code>=> I want some plain tofu spread!
=> Just add it on top.
=> I want some spinach tofu spread!
=> Just add it on top.
=> I want some honey walnut tofu spread!
=> Just add it on top.
=> That's all! Thanks!</code></pre>

        <p>Ahh, the classic plain-spinach-honey-walnut combo. Since all of my objects are tofu spreads, an array worked pretty well here.</p>

        <p>However, ordering a bagel is never so simple. Not only must I choose a spread - I also better pick out a bagel and figure out if I want that sucker toasted. This is a  great job for...</p>

        <h3>Hashes</h3>
        <p>Objects in a hash are indexed with the keys assigned to them (key-value pairs). They're great if you want to call your objects in any order without having to remember a number associatd with them. Instead, just come up with a key that makes a lot of sense for its associated value. I'll use hashes to associate different categories of the bagel-ordering process with my preferences for each.</p>

        <pre><code>order = {
  "bagel" => "chocolate chip",
  "spread" => "lox",
  "preparation" => "toasted",
}

order.each do |category, preference|
  puts "I'll take #{preference} for my #{category}."
end

puts "That's it! Great!"</code></pre>

<pre><code>=> I'll take chocolate chip for my bagel.
=> I'll take lox for my spread.
=> I'll take toasted for my preparation.
=> That's it! Great!</code></pre>

        <p>So, that's a little bit about arrays &amp; hashes! Both are great for working with a bunch of objects at once; it just depends on how you want to index those objects. Save your voice and your fingers! Avoid redundancies with these epic iterators.</p>
