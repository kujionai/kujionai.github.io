      <div id="content">

        <p>Dear People I've Paired With,

        <p>When you gave me the pairing-session green-light of affirmation, I was on-the-next-level pumped. Otptimized learning with a generous topping of world-class friendship, all wrapped up in a one-to-three-hour bundle! I literally could not wait.
        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://media2.giphy.com/media/hKW0FFvpVSvmM/giphy.gif" />

        <p>Also, I was pretty nervous. I mean, what if you know way more about Ruby classes than I do? You probably do. Scratch that - you DEFINITELY do. Oh, the shame ... maybe I should put this pairing date off until, you know ... until after I know everything too.</p>

        <p>But you were so, so cool. I learned a lot from you for sure, but the most surprising thing that happened is that you learned from me, too. You were into my knowledge of Sublime Text shortcuts. You thanked me for teaching you about a new method I'd been playing around with. To my surprise, I emerged from our time together feeling like I was a valuable member of an awesome team - the team of ME and YOU.</p>

        <p>So, I went home. I slept well. I woke up the next morning with bright eyes and a heart full of code. And when I recieved your feedback from out pairign session, I couldn't help but take the "WAY TO BE NATURALLY GREAT AT THIS!" parts like ...</p>
        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/fPKavkCyl9vOw/giphy.gif" />
        <p>... And the "YOU COULD WORK ON THIS!" feedback a little more like ...</p>

        <p>But, I really am learning from the feedback you took the time to give me. And I'm growing! I've become more aware of when I'm changing the subject from booleans to baked goods, and I'm getting more and more comfortable each code-aborative day with speaking up when our syntax is wack.</p>

        <p>And, when I leave you feedback, I'll do my best to offer you the gift of alternate-perspective as well.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/lPkgVnlOTin5e/giphy.gif" />

        <p>What I'm tryimg to say is, <i>thank you so much</i>, People I've Paired With. Thank you for hearing me out. Thank you for taking the time to give me the nuturing honesty that leads to growth. And thank you for giving me the courage to return the favor.</p>

        <p>Until next time,<br><span class="signature">Rosa Pergams</span></p>

      <div id="tagline">
        <div id="tagline_1">Ruby Classes</div>
        <div id="tagline_2">Let's hang out.</div>
      </div>

      <div id="content">

        <p>So, think of an object. Any object. Did you think of a caper? Didn't think so. Well, that's an object. However, while the salted and pickled <i>Capparis spinosa</i> bud (that's a caper!) stands on its own as a glorious ingredient, why let it hang out with objects that serve a similar purpose?</p>

        <p>We can group objects with a class, which is used to construct an object. classes usually contain multiple methods in them like this:</p>

        <pre><code>class NYC_Bagel
  def initialize(component, color)
    # Instance variables
    @component = component
    @color = color
  end

  def description
    puts "I am #{@component}! Check out my lovely #{@color} color."
  end

  def essential
    puts "I'm an essential component of the classic NYC bagel!"
  end
end</pre></code>

<p>We've got an method <code class="inline_code">descriptions</code>that passes in the description of a componenent of the classic NYC bagel, and one <code class="inline_code">essential</code> that declares each ingredients' importance. Both methods are hanging out in out class <code class="inline_code">NYC_Bagel</code>.</p>

<p>Now, instead of creating new methods each time we want to reference a new NYC bagel component (capers inluded, of course), we can just refer to them as instances of the <code class="inline_code">NYC_Bagel</code> class like this:</p>

        <pre><code>d = NYC_Bagel.new("a butter knife", "silver")
d.description
d.essential

d = NYC_Bagel.new("the everything topping", "salt-n'-pepper")
d.description
d.essential

d = NYC_Bagel.new("cream cheese", "off-white")
d.description
d.essential

d = NYC_Bagel.new("lox", "pink")
d.description
d.essential

d = NYC_Bagel.new("capers", "emerald")
d.description
d.essential</pre></code>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/bagel_class.jpeg" alt="Title" />

        <pre><code=> I am a butter knife! Check out my lovely silver color.
=> I'm an essential component of the classic NYC bagel!

=> I am the everything topping! Check out my lovely salt-n'-pepper color.
=> I'm an essential component of the classic NYC bagel!

=> I am cream cheese! Check out my lovely off-white color.
=> I'm an essential component of the classic NYC bagel!

=> I am lox! Check out my lovely pink color.
=> I'm an essential component of the classic NYC bagel!

=> I am capers! Check out my lovely emerald color.
=> I'm an essential component of the classic NYC bagel!</pre></code>

<p>Awesome! That was so much easier with a class. Keep it tasty!</p>

        </p>
        <p>So, I must say that I've been a black woman for quite a while now (I'm certain that twenty-two years is a very, very long time).</p>

        <p>I've studied Anthropology at a fancy liberal arts school, and spent summers teaching bicycle mechanics. Now, I'm doing my best to shove my foot into the door of computer programming as a student at the oh-so-awesome <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp.</a></p>

        <p>Let me tell you, that even with access to Dev Bootcamp's infinitely supportive community, the gateway to the Code-World is hefty when your peers (and most of your role models ) never seem to look like you. I believe I've developed mid-sized  <a class="blog_post_link" href="https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/overcoming-impostor-syndrome-bdae04e46ec5" target="_blank">imposter-syndrome-shaped,</a> eggplant-esque bruises on both pinky toes.</p>

        <p>I'm certain, however, that this door is beginning to open for women and People of Color due to the amazing work of folks like the seven bad-ass hackers (listed in no particular order) you're about to read about. These ladies are commited to spreading the tech love around, and they are changing the face of computer programming.</p>

        <div id="tagline_1"><a id="blog_single" href="blog/t4-enumerable-methods.html">Ruby's Map Method</a></div>
        <div id="tagline_2">An Enumerable for the well-adapted glutton.</div>
      </div>

      <div id="content">

        <p>Let's say (with inspiration from a most clever <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> challenge) we've got some bagels, and want another bagel. And, of course, we wanna code about it.</p>

        <pre><code>more_bagels = ["I've" "got" 2 "bagels" "!" "Now" "I" "want" 3 "."]</pre></code>

        <p>Great! Awesome start. The array <code class="inline_code">more_bagels</code> Tells the whole wanting-another-bagel story. UNLESS, of course, I get that extra bagel, in which case it's only natural to want one more.</p>

        <p>But, how might I freely adjust my <code class="inline_code">more_bagels</code> array to properly emulate my bottomless gluttony? It's time to bust out Ruby's <code class="inline_code">#map</code> method!</p>

        <p>But why  <code class="inline_code">#map</code>? Well, I want to change the numbers in my array based on the number of bagels I have, so I'll create a method that accepts both an array and a number as arguments. Unlike <code class="inline_code">#each</code>, which just does something to each element without storing the results anywhere, <code class="inline_code">#map</code> creates a new array with the results of whatever action you're performing. It's the same as the <code class="inline_code">#collect</code> method, so  you can think of <code class="inline_code">#map</code> as 'collecting' the results of an action into a brand new array.</p>

        <p>In my case, I'm executing some delicious addition unto all of the numbers in my array.</p>

        <pre><code>def bagels_on_bagels(array, num)
  array.map { |obj|
    if obj.is_a?Fixnum
      obj + num
    else
      obj
  end }
end</pre></code>

        <p>Cool! So, I'm letting that <code class="inline_code">#map</code> method have at it on my <code class="inline_code">array</code> argument, finding those <code class="inline_code">Fixnum</code>s and adding some <code class="inline_code">num</code>s to them. Time to call my new method:</p>

        <pre><code>bagels_on_bagels(more_bagels, 7)</pre></code>

        <p>Alright! let's see what all this method madness returns.</p>

        <pre><code>=> ["I've" "got" 9 "bagels" "!" "Now" "I" "want" 10 "."]</pre></code>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/bagels.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>Perfect! One more bagel, no matter how many I've already hoarded inside of my face. So, <code class="inline_code">#map</code> created a new array for me with the results of performing my method on each element! The <code class="inline_code">#map</code> sure is great for returning an ever-adjusting desire for more.</p>

        <p>Wanna fill up on <code class="inline_code">#map</code>, <code class="inline_code">#select</code> and other life-changing Enumerable Methods?

        <p>Here&#8217;s the difference between the two mindsets - first the what-I-sometimes-say-to-myself fixed-mindset stuff, and then the how-I'm-learning-to-speak-to-myself-like-someone-I-actually-like growth-mindset goodness.</p>

        <h3>Fixed Mindset</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>&quot;Learning how to use Git will be tough. I don&#8217;t wanna.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Arrays are kind of confusing. &amp;#%!@?! arrays.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Spending more than 20 minutes on this method might prove that I&#8217;m a moron.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Use Version Control, you say? Sounds like you just said that you hate me.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Oh, you built this? I guess I suck.&quot;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>&quot;Learning how to use Git will be tough. Bring it on.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Arrays are kind of confusing. Time to buckle down.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;The 3 hours I&#8217;ve spent on this method have served as important learning time. I&#8217;m heading in the right direction!&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Use Version Control, you say? Makes sense. Sounds good.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Oh, you built this? Can&#8217;t wait to tackle a big project of my own!&quot;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Keep that positive self-talk coming! Don&#8217;t forget that someone is listening.</p>

      <div id="content">
        <p>This past Wednesday, I had the pleasure of spending a ridiculous amount of super-fun and extra-educational quality time with DBC cohort-mate and brand-new alpaca-loving friend <a>Mai</a>.<p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/alpaca.png" alt="Title" /

        <p>As she was visiting NYC from Virginia, I chose our meeting place. We naturally found ourselves at Manhattan's favorite how-is-this-so-freaking-delicious bagel shop.</p>

        <p>It also so happened that I had a gross cold on this particular outing. So, let's say I was going to write a program to ease up the order process. Just so I don't have to repeat myself too much with my sore throat.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna write two programs. I'm gonna write one with an <b>array</b>. Then I'm gonna write one with a <b>hash</b>.</p>

        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>Objects in an array are indexed with integers starting at 0. You can't really associate them with anything else besides those numbers, so they're great for lists of really similar things. I'll use them to pile on the tofu spreads (that's cream cheese for vegans &amp; lactose-intolerant people).</p>

<pre><code>tofu_spread = ["plain", "spinach", "honey walnut"]

tofu_spread.each do |flavor|
  puts "I want some #{flavor} tofu spread!"
  puts "Just add it on top."
end

puts "That's all! Thanks!"

=> I want some plain tofu spread!
=> Just add it on top.
=> I want some spinach tofu spread!
=> Just add it on top.
=> I want some honey walnut tofu spread!
=> Just add it on top.
=> That's all! Thanks!</code></pre>

        <p>Ahh, the classic plain-spinach-honey-walnut combo. Since all of my objects are tofu spreads, an array worked pretty well here.</p>

        <p>However, ordering a bagel is never so simple. Not only must I choose a spread - I also better pick out a bagel and figure out if I want that sucker toasted. This is a  great job for...</p>

        <h3>Hashes</h3>
        <p>Objects in a hash are indexed with the keys assigned to them (key-value pairs). They're great if you want to call your objects in any order without having to remember a number associatd with them. Instead, just come up with a key that makes a lot of sense for its associated value. I'll use hashes to associate different categories of the bagel-ordering process with my preferences for each.</p>

<pre><code>order = {
  "bagel" => "chocolate chip",
  "spread" => "lox",
  "preparation" => "toasted",
}

order.each do |category, preference|
  puts "I'll take #{preference} for my #{category}."
end

puts "That's it! Great!"

=> I'll take chocolate chip for my bagel.
=> I'll take lox for my spread.
=> I'll take toasted for my preparation.
=> That's it! Great!</code></pre>

        <p>So, that's a little bit about arrays &amp; hashes! both are great for working with a bunch of objects at once; it just depends on how you want to index those objects. Save your voice and your fingers! Avoid redundancies with these epic iterators.</p>

        <p>Let's say you've got some <b>content</b> worthy of a place to call its own.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/content.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>Before we glam up with stylesheet condiments, we've got to start with the basics. That's the HTML-hand-crafted, artisinal, fresh-out-the oven goodness in the middle.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/html.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>Then, we can use CSS to add some <b>padding</b> to our content.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/padding.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>Padding is the space between our element border and the element content. Here, it's the plate serving as extra space holding our bagel-content in its luxurous ceramic arms. The padding property's CSS sometimes looks like this.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/padding_css.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>We've also got a lil' <b>border</b>, the space between the edge of the plate (the edge of the padding) and the world beyond our element.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/border.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>Take a peak at the border property's CSS.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/border_css.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>lastly, we've got our <b>margin</b>. We're talking the space around elements. It's completely transparent - just a little bit of breathing room for your precious material.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/margin.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>The margin property's CSS sometimes looks like this.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/margin_css.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>That's a little bit about margin, border, and padding properties! Don't hesitate to give your stuff all the love, clearance and artsy sparkle you see fit.</p>
