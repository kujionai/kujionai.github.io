        <p class="blog_post_quote">"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."
        <br>
        - Thomas A. Edison</p>

        <p>As a college student with a bizaar schedule, I came to appreciate the art of napping. So much so, that I even attempted to fill a miniature dictionary documenting distinct doze-types. This project (and its inspiration, the naps themselves) stopped almost immediately when I moved to New York City, and the reason is coffee.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="../imgs/coffee_heart.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>It's not like I started drinking coffee <i>because</i> I wanted stay awake for twelve-hour bouts. It's just that, bugging out at a tiny screen in my bedroom was getting a little lonely. When I discovered the fellowship championed by my local coffee shops, I sauntered right in and ordered myself... a coffee, just because I wasn't really sure what else I could get on the cheap. The rest, if I may, is history.</p>

        <pre><code>proverbs = ["Coffee. The most important meal of the day.", "All you need is love. And more coffee.", "A yawn is a silent scream for coffee."]</code></pre>

        <p>You can see that, right? It's a Ruby array with three strings in it. When the time comes to share this astuteness, there's thousands of ways to do it. Let's get it done a <b>bloc</b>.</p>

        <p>Blocs are bits of code that do <i>some awesome thing</i>. They can be defined with either the keywords <code class="inline_code">do</code> and <code class="inline_code">end</code> or with curly braces <code class="inline_code">{}</code>.</p>

        <pre><code>proverbs.each do |proverb|
  puts proverb
end

proverbs.each { |proverb| puts proverb }</code></pre>

        <p>You can think of blocs as a way to create nameless methods. Since they don't have a name, we can only call them once - meaning that after the blocs above <code class="inline_code">puts</code> our <code class="inline_code">proverbs</code>, they'll vanish forever.</p>

        <p>That's great - except wisdom should be shared, not liquefied. That's why we'll wrap our bloc in an object called a <b>proc</b>, which is a lot like a method. Awesome! Our bloc now has a name, and that name is <code class="inline_code">coffee</code>.</p>

        <pre><code>pass_it_on = Proc.new { |proverb| puts proverb }
coffee = proverbs.each(&amp;pass_it_on)</code></pre>

        <p>Procs have a doppelganger that go by the name of <b>lambda</b>. Which, Like procs, are objects. In fact, they're identical to procs in nearly every way.</p>

        <pre><code>pass_it_on = lambda { |proverb| puts proverb }
coffee = proverbs.each(&amp;pass_it_on)</code></pre>

      <p>However, there are a <i>couple</i> of ifferences between procs and lambdas. Lambdas keep track of the arguments passed to them (procs do not) and return an error if there's an inconsistemncy. Also, when they return, lambdas pass control back to the calling method (procs return immediately without going back to the calling method).</p>

      <p>That's a little about procs, blocs, and lambdas! There's always more than one fantastic way to reach any goal - and maybe a lot of other ways, too.</p>

        <p>Dear People I've Paired With,

        <p>When you gave me the pairing-session green-light of affirmation, I was on-the-next-level pumped. Optimized learning with a generous topping of world-class friendship, all wrapped up in a one-to-three-hour bundle! I literally could not wait.
        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://media2.giphy.com/media/hKW0FFvpVSvmM/giphy.gif" />

        <p>Also, I was pretty nervous. I mean, what if you know way more about Ruby classes than I do? You probably do. Scratch that - you DEFINITELY do. Oh, the shame ... maybe I should put this pairing date off until, you know ... until after I know everything too.</p>

        <p>But you were so, so cool. I learned a lot from you for sure, but the most surprising thing that happened is that you learned from me, too. You were into my knowledge of Sublime Text shortcuts. You thanked me for teaching you a new method I'd been playing around with. To my surprise, I emerged from our time together feeling like I was a valuable member of an awesome team - the team of ME and YOU.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/47045dce511c3bb160ba4f3cbd6ff0fa/tumblr_n21bysbScb1qzixlyo1_500.gif" />

        <p>So, I went home. I slept well. I woke up the next morning with bright eyes and a heart full of code. And when I recieved your feedback from our pairing session, I couldn't help but take the <i>way to be naturally great at this!</i> parts like ...</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/fPKavkCyl9vOw/giphy.gif" />

        <p>... And the <i>you could work on this!</i> feedback a little more like ...</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://s9.favim.com/orig/130929/cry-disappointment-gif-girl-Favim.com-959942.gif" />

        <p>But, I really am learning from the feedback you took the time to give me. And I'm growing! I've become more aware of when I've changed the subject from booleans to baked goods, and I'm getting more and more comfortable each code-aborative day with speaking up when our syntax is wack.</p>

        <p>And, when I leave you feedback, I'll do my best to follow your lead as I offer you my perspective.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/lPkgVnlOTin5e/giphy.gif" />

        <p>What I'm trying to say is, <i>thank you so much</i>, People I've Paired With. Thank you for hearing me out. Thank you for taking the time to give me the nurturing honesty that leads to growth. And thank you for giving me the courage to return the favor.</p>

        <p>Until next time,<br><span class="signature">Rosa Pergams</span></p>

      <div id="tagline">
        <div id="tagline_1"><a id="blog_single" href="blog/t5-ruby-classes.html">Ruby Classes</a></div>
        <div id="tagline_2">Greeting the wildlife with ordered expectations.</div>
      </div>

      <div id="content">

        <p>Not long after moving a stone's throw South of Brooklyn's Prospect Park about six months ago, I fell in love with the neighborhood's WILDLIFE. We're talking squirrels. Sparrows. And to my purest delight, we've got cats on cats on cats EVERYWHERE.</p>

        <p>To Ruby-document some of my favorite feline neighbors, I've created the following <b>class</b> called <code class="inline_code">Neighborhood_Cat</code>.

        <pre><code>class Neighborhood_Cat
  def initialize(location, favorite_activity)
    @location = location
    @favorite_activity = favorite_activity
  end
  def hang_out
    puts "My favorite hangout spot is the #{@location}! Next time we meet, I'll definitely #{@favorite_activity}."
  end
  def meow
    puts "Meow! Meow!"
  end
end</pre></code>

          <p>Classes are perfect for grouping behaviors (methods) into convenient bundles that allow you to effortlessly create many objects that behave in basically the same way. By creating the class <code class="inline_code">Neighborhood_Cat</code>, I can now create objects that are <b>instances</b> of this class - different neightborhood cats that all <code class="inline_code">meow</code> and <code class="inline_code">hang_out</code> (these are the methods bundled in the class), but have different <code class="inline_code">location</code>s and <code class="inline_code">favorite_activity</code>s (these are the arguments passed into the <code class="inline_code">initialize</code> method).</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/neighborhood_cat.png" alt="Title" />

          <p>Each Neighborhood cat has a favorite <code class="inline_code">location</code> and an expected <code class="inline_code">favorite_activity</code>, so I'll make those the arguments for <code class="inline_code">Neighborhood_Cat</code>'s <code class="inline_code">initialize</code> method (<code class="inline_code">initialize</code> gets called each time we create a new instance of a class).</p>

<p></p>

        <pre><code>brown_cat = Neighborhood_Cat.new("corner deli checkout counter", "stay asleep while you try to get my attention")
brown_cat.hang_out
brown_cat.meow

black_cat = Neighborhood_Cat.new("overgrown lot next to the Catholic School", "run away and then look back at you like I want you to chase me")
black_cat.hang_out
black_cat.meow

grey_cat = Neighborhood_Cat.new("new duplex close to the subway stop", "butt my head against your hand")
grey_cat.hang_out
grey_cat.meow</pre></code>

        <p>Sweet! We created new instances of our <code class="inline_code">Neighborhood_cats</code> class and called the methods on each instance. Here's what we'll get when we run this in our terminal:</p>

        <pre><code>=> My favorite hangout spot is the corner deli checkout counter! Next time we meet, I'll definitely stay asleep while you try to get my attention.
=> Meow! Meow!
=> My favorite hangout spot is the overgrown lot next to the Catholic School! Next time we meet, I'll definitely run away and then look back at you like I want you to chase me.
=> Meow! Meow!
=> My favorite hangout spot is the new duplex close to the subway stop! Next time we meet, I'll definitely butt my head against your hand.
=> Meow! Meow!</pre></code>

        <p>Awesome! Keeping all those cats straight is pretty simple with a class. Don't forget to greet your furry neighbors!</p>

        </p>
        <p>So, I must say that I've been a black woman for quite a while now (I'm certain that twenty-two years is a very, very long time).</p>

        <p>I've studied Anthropology at a fancy liberal arts school, and spent summers teaching bicycle mechanics. Now, I'm doing my best to shove my foot into the door of computer programming as a student at the oh-so-awesome <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp.</a></p>

        <p>Let me tell you, that even with access to Dev Bootcamp's infinitely supportive community, the gateway to the Code-World is hefty when your peers (and most of your role models ) never seem to look like you. I believe I've developed mid-sized  <a class="blog_post_link" href="https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/overcoming-impostor-syndrome-bdae04e46ec5" target="_blank">imposter-syndrome-shaped,</a> eggplant-esque bruises on both pinky toes.</p>

        <p>I'm certain, however, that this door is beginning to open for women and People of Color due to the amazing work of folks like the seven bad-ass hackers (listed in no particular order) you're about to read about. These ladies are commited to spreading the tech love around, and they are changing the face of computer programming.</p>
