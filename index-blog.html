        <p>The quote above, spotted in a right-column ad gracing the border of the <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" target="_blank">article</a> this blog-post is about, rang true to me as I reflected upon <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" target="_blank">Carol Dweck&#8217;s Fixed Mindset vs Growth Mindset.</a></p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://i.imgur.com/rVo7IMl.jpg" alt="Title" />

        <p>Here&#8217;s the difference between the two mindsets - first the what-I-sometimes-say-to-myself fixed-mindset stuff, and then the how-I'm-learning-to-speak-to-myself-like-someone-I-actually-like growth-mindset goodness.</p>

        <h3>Fixed Mindset</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>&quot;Learning how to use Git will be tough. I don&#8217;t wanna.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Arrays are kind of confusing. &amp;#%!@?! arrays.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Spending more than 20 minutes on this method might prove that I&#8217;m a moron.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Use Version Control, you say? Sounds like you just said that you hate me.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Oh, you built this? I guess I suck.&quot;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>&quot;Learning how to use Git will be tough. Bring it on.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Arrays are kind of confusing. Time to buckle down.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;The 3 hours I&#8217;ve spent on this method have served as important learning time. I&#8217;m heading in the right direction!&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Use Version Control, you say? Makes sense. Sounds good.&quot;</li>
          <li>&quot;Oh, you built this? Can&#8217;t wait to tackle a big project of my own!&quot;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Keep that positive self-talk coming! Don&#8217;t forget that someone is listening.</p>

      <div id="content">
        <p>This past Wednesday, I had the pleasure of spending a ridiculous amount of super-fun and extra-educational quality time with DBC cohort-mate and brand-new alpaca-loving friend <a>Mai</a>.<p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/alpaca.png" alt="Title" /

        <p>As she was visiting NYC from Virginia, I chose our meeting place. We naturally found ourselves at Manhattan's favorite how-is-this-so-freaking-delicious bagel shop.</p>

        <p>It also so happened that I had a gross cold on this particular outing. So, let's say I was going to write a program to ease up the order process. Just so I don't have to repeat myself too much with my sore throat.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna write two programs. I'm gonna write one with an <b>array</b>. Then I'm gonna write one with a <b>hash</b>.</p>

        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>Objects in an array are indexed with integers starting at 0. You can't really associate them with anything else besides those numbers, so they're great for lists of really similar things. I'll use them to pile on the tofu spreads (that's cream cheese for vegans &amp; lactose-intolerant people).</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/array.png" alt="Title" />
<!--         <pre><code>tofu_spread = ["plain", "spinach", "honey walnut"]

tofu_spread.each do |flavor|
  puts "I want some #{flavor} tofu spread!"
  puts "Just add it on top."
end

puts "That's all! Thanks!"

# => I want some plain tofu spread!
# => Just add it on top.
# => I want some spinach tofu spread!
# => Just add it on top.
# => I want some honey walnut tofu spread!
# => Just add it on top.
# => That's all! Thanks!</code></pre>-->

        <p>Ahh, the classic plain-spinach-honey-walnut combo. Since all of my objects are tofu spreads, an array worked pretty well here.</p>

        <p>However, ordering a bagel is never so simple. Not only must I choose a spread - I also better pick out a bagel and figure out if I want that sucker toasted. This is a  great job for...</p>

        <h3>Hashes</h3>
        <p>Objects in a hash are indexed with the keys assigned to them (key-value pairs). They're great if you want to call your objects in any order without having to remember a number associatd with them. Instead, just come up with a key that makes a lot of sense for its associated value. I'll use hashes to associate different categories of the bagel-ordering process with my preferences for each.</p>

        <!--<pre><code>order = {
  "bagel" => "chocolate chip",
  "spread" => "lox",
  "preparation" => "toasted",
}

order.each do |category, preference|
  puts "I'll take #{preference} for my #{category}."
end

puts "That's it! Great!"

# => I'll take chocolate chip for my bagel.
# => I'll take lox for my spread.
# => I'll take toasted for my preparation.
# => That's it! Great!</code></pre> -->

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/hash.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>So, that's a little bit about arrays &amp; hashes! both are great for working with a bunch of objects at once; it just depends on how you want to index those objects. Save your voice and your fingers! Avoid redundancies with these epic iterators.</p>

        <p class="blog_post_quote">"Art is like a border of flowers along the course of civilization."<br>-Lincoln Steffens</p>

        <p>Let's say you've got some <b>content</b> worthy of a place to call its own.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/content.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>Before we glam up with stylesheet condiments, we've got to start with the basics. That's the HTML-hand-crafted, artisinal, fresh-out-the oven goodness in the middle.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/html.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>Then, we can use CSS to add some <b>padding</b> to our content.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/padding.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>Padding is the space between our element border and the element content. Here, it's the plate serving as extra space holding our bagel-content in its luxurous ceramic arms. The padding property's CSS sometimes looks like this.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/padding_css.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>We've also got a lil' <b>border</b>, the space between the edge of the plate (the edge of the padding) and the world beyond our element.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/border.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>Take a peak at the border property's CSS.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/border_css.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>lastly, we've got our <b>margin</b>. We're talking the space around elements. It's completely transparent - just a little bit of breathing room for your precious material.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/margin.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>The margin property's CSS sometimes looks like this.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="imgs/margin_css.png" alt="Title" />

        <p>That's a little bit about margin, border, and padding properties! Don't hesitate to give your stuff all the love, clearance and artsy sparkle you see fit.</p>
