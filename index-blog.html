        <p class="blog_post_quote">"Never trust anyone who says they do not see color. This means to them, you are invisible."
        <br>
        - Nayyirah Waheed</p>

        <p>Let me tell you a story about the most racist thing I've ever done. That I'm aware of, anyways.</p>

        <p>Imagine a steamy Mid-July in Washington, DC. The vegan restaurant where I bartended while completing an <a class="blog_post_link" href="http://www.hrc.org/" target="_blank">internship</a> blocks away. A legend amongst the waiters by the name of John Cho (I'd never met him, but he was clearly the king of infamy). And a former waiter at the same establishment, Callaway Don.</p>

        <p>Callaway Don enters the vegan restaurant, hoping to run into old co-workers. Upon noticing him chatting up the staff from behind the bar, a twisted and shameful lightbulb goes off in my head.</p>

        <p>Before I knew it, I had word-puked all over the poor guy.</p>

        <p>"Are you John Cho?" I asked Callaway Don with earnest. He was not.</p>
        <p>It just so happens that <code class="inline_code">one_asian_person != another_asian_person</code>. There can even be multiple Asian people who've worked at the same restaurant! Apparently, these were both revelations to me.</p>

        <p>When we do <i>racist things</i> (and they are VERY easy to do), we isolate other people. We send them the message that they don't belong, and that we don't see their personhood with the same validity with which we perceive our own. <i>Racist things</i> can minimize intelligence, deny individuality, and violate self-worth. And most of the time, <i>racist things</i> just kind of come out when our intentions are only the best.</p>

        <p>With that in mind, here are some <i>racist things</i> (all very, very common) that I (a black person) am hurt by. If you've done any of these <i>racist things</i>, don't freak! I was forgiven for my <i>racist thing</i> in spades (Callaway Don and I just celebrated our two-year anniversary). Everyone knows that no one is born knowing everything (just, you know, try to cut it out from now on).</p>

        <p><b>"You know, I don't even really see you as black."</b> OPEN YOUR EYES.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr01/2013/5/2/10/anigif_enhanced-buzz-2053-1367505162-0.gif" />
        <p><b>Exaggeratedly snapping your neck in my direction.</b> I have never even seen a black person do this.</p>

        <p>So, that's my abbreviated list of <i>racist things</i> that make me sad. Racial microagressions such as these imply that being black makes me anything besides awesome, and they take a lot of energy to deal with. Do I speak strangely? Do I look weird? Or am I just in the wrong place? You can start to see how stereotypes can make one feel like an outsider, and there's nothing more detrimental to success than the belief that you're not welcome.</p>

        <p>Let's learn our lessons, forgive ourselves, and do our best to crush the stereotypes we hold before they smother our friends. It's easier said than done, but we've all got to start somewhere.</p>

        <p class="blog_post_quote">"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."
        <br>
        - Thomas A. Edison</p>

        <p>As a college student with a bizaar schedule, I came to appreciate the art of napping. So much so, that I even attempted to fill a miniature dictionary documenting distinct doze-types. This project (and its inspiration, the naps themselves) stopped almost immediately when I moved to New York City, and the reason is coffee.</p>

        <!--<img class="blog_post_img" src="../imgs/coffee_heart.png" alt="Title" />-->
        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://media3.giphy.com/media/U6P1Lp8tbZBfy/giphy.gif" alt="Title" />

        <p>It's not like I started drinking coffee <i>because</i> I wanted stay awake for twelve-hour bouts. It's just that, bugging out at a tiny screen in my bedroom was getting a little lonely. When I discovered the fellowship championed by my local coffee shops, I sauntered right in and ordered myself... a coffee, just because I wasn't really sure what else I could get on the cheap. The rest, if I may, is history.</p>

        <pre><code>proverbs = ["Coffee. The most important meal of the day.", "All you need is love. And more coffee.", "A yawn is a silent scream for coffee."]</code></pre>

        <p>You can see that, right? It's a Ruby array with three strings in it. When the time comes to share this astuteness, there's thousands of ways to do it. Let's get it done with a <b>bloc</b>.</p>

        <p>Blocs are bits of code that do <i>some awesome thing</i>. They can be defined with either the keywords <code class="inline_code">do</code> and <code class="inline_code">end</code> or with curly braces <code class="inline_code">{}</code>.</p>

        <pre><code>proverbs.each do |proverb|
  puts proverb
end

proverbs.each { |proverb| puts proverb }</code></pre>

        <p>You can think of blocs as a way to create nameless methods. Since they don't have a name, we can only call them once - meaning that after the blocs above <code class="inline_code">puts</code> our <code class="inline_code">proverbs</code>, they'll vanish forever.</p>

        <p>That's great - except wisdom should be shared, not liquefied. Let's wrap our bloc in an object called a <b>proc</b>, which is a lot like a method. Awesome! Our bloc now has a name, and that name is <code class="inline_code">coffee</code>.</p>

        <pre><code>pass_it_on = Proc.new { |proverb| puts proverb }
coffee = proverbs.each(&amp;pass_it_on)</code></pre>

        <p>Procs have a doppelganger that go by the name of <b>lambda</b>. Which, Like procs, are objects. In fact, they're identical to procs in nearly every way.</p>

        <pre><code>pass_it_on = lambda { |proverb| puts proverb }
coffee = proverbs.each(&amp;pass_it_on)</code></pre>

      <p>However, there are a <i>couple</i> of differences between procs and lambdas. Lambdas keep track of the arguments passed to them (procs do not) and return an error if there's an inconsistemncy. Also, when they return, lambdas pass control back to the calling method (procs return immediately without going back to the calling method).</p>

      <p>That's a little about procs, blocs, lambdas, naps, and coffee! There's always more than one fantastic way to reach any goal - and maybe a lot of other ways, too.</p>

      </div>

      <div id="content">

        <p>Dear People I've Paired With,

        <p>When you gave me the pairing-session green-light of affirmation, I was on-the-next-level pumped. Optimized learning with a generous topping of world-class friendship, all wrapped up in a one-to-three-hour bundle! I literally could not wait.
        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://media2.giphy.com/media/hKW0FFvpVSvmM/giphy.gif" />

        <p>Also, I was pretty nervous. I mean, what if you know way more about Ruby classes than I do? You probably do. Scratch that - you DEFINITELY do. Oh, the shame ... maybe I should put this pairing date off until, you know ... until after I know everything too.</p>

        <p>But you were so, so cool. I learned a lot from you for sure, but the most surprising thing that happened is that you learned from me, too. You were into my knowledge of Sublime Text shortcuts. You thanked me for teaching you a new method I'd been playing around with. To my surprise, I emerged from our time together feeling like I was a valuable member of an awesome team - the team of ME and YOU.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/47045dce511c3bb160ba4f3cbd6ff0fa/tumblr_n21bysbScb1qzixlyo1_500.gif" />

        <p>So, I went home. I slept well. I woke up the next morning with bright eyes and a heart full of code. And when I recieved your feedback from our pairing session, I couldn't help but take the <i>way to be naturally great at this!</i> parts like ...</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/fPKavkCyl9vOw/giphy.gif" />

        <p>... And the <i>you could work on this!</i> feedback a little more like ...</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://s9.favim.com/orig/130929/cry-disappointment-gif-girl-Favim.com-959942.gif" />

        <p>But, I really am learning from the feedback you took the time to give me. And I'm growing! I've become more aware of when I've changed the subject from booleans to baked goods, and I'm getting more and more comfortable each code-aborative day with speaking up when our syntax is wack.</p>

        <p>And, when I leave you feedback, I'll do my best to follow your lead as I offer you my perspective.</p>

        <img class="blog_post_img" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/lPkgVnlOTin5e/giphy.gif" />

        <p>What I'm trying to say is, <i>thank you so much</i>, People I've Paired With. Thank you for hearing me out. Thank you for taking the time to give me the nurturing honesty that leads to growth. And thank you for giving me the courage to return the favor.</p>

        <p>Until next time,<br><span class="signature">Rosa Pergams</span></p>
